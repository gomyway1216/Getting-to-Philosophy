Getting to Philosophy
==============================

The goal of it is to reach Philosophy. That was working in 2017, but currently (2018) it seems that many things reach to Psychology.

Function
------------

Using generator, when user type a word and if there exists a page of the word such as "human" in Wikipedia, if you iterate through

Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, would usually lead to the Philosophy article.

Using generator, it was supposed to show the route to Philosophy, but it doesn't reach to Philosophy anymore. Instead, I found that many keywords reach to Psychology.


Achievement 
---------------

1. Learned how to use general type and produce general type value ex) even number, number, etc.
2. Implemented iterator.
