Getting to Philosophy
==============================

The goal of it is to reach Philosophy. That was working in 2017, but currently (2018) it seems that many things reach to Psychology.

Function
------------

Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, would usually lead to the Philosophy article.
(Wikipedia)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

Using generator, it was supposed to show the route to Philosophy when user type a word that exists in Wikipedia page, but it doesn't reach to Philosophy anymore. Instead, I found that many keywords reach to Psychology.


Achievement 
---------------

1. Learned how to use general type and produce general type value ex) even number, number, etc.
2. Implemented iterator.
